# Rock Paper Scissors

This is the Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors assignment.

## Pseudocode:

    Create two variables
        - humanScore is 0
        - computerScore is 0

    Have the computer randomly pick between rock, paper, or scissors
        (ended up using Math.floor with Math.random)

    Have the human enter in their choice
        (used simple prompt)

    Compare the two choices to determine the winner
        (i used a bunch of if statements, in my eyes its ugly and thers probably something better, <br /> but at the same time this is such a small program that it hardly matters)

    Increase winners score

    Begin new round
